CODE IMPROVEMENTS
=================

- Create a 3rd option on StorageHint for IN_CACHE where we use LRU and for the IN_DISK option turn LRU off.
- Create a sparse matrix obj on top of Dataframe by using AbstractRealMatrix.
- Use {@inheritDoc} in the methods that have the same description as interfaces. Remove duplicate javadocs.
- Do we need LinkedHashMap for Records? Maybe make the hashmap where necessary.
- Add a predictRecord() method BaseMLmodel and refactor the code to be implemented by every algorithm.
- Add multithreading support.
- Update all maven plugins and dependencies to their latest versions.
    - Add support for MapDB 2.0 once a stable version is released.
    - Upgrade maven-surefire to 2.19.1.

- Add the ability to call Machine Learning algorithms from command line like in Mahout.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

- Improve the code documentation.
- Write How-to blog post on building a Text Classification model.


NEW ALGORITHMS
==============

- Rewrite PCA to avoid using RealMatrix.
- Add regularization in the currenlty supported algorithms.
- Write a Mixture of Gaussians clustering method.
- Develop the FunkSVD and PLSI as probabilistic version of SVD.
- Include an anomaly detection algorithm.
- Add the ability to search through the configuration space and find the best performing algorithmic configuration.
