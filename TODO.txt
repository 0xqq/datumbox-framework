CODE IMPROVEMENTS
=================

- Save and load method for Dataset.

- Support of better Transformers (Zscore, decouple boolean transforming from numeric etc).
- Write a ShuffleSplitValidator class similar to KFold. Perhaps we need a single Validator class and separate Splitters.
- Write generic optimizers instead of having optimization methods in the algorithms.

- Support MapDB 3.0 once a stable version is released. Remove the HOTFIX for MapDB bug #664.
- Try to separate persistent storage in a separate module that is inherited by common.


NEW FEATURES
============

- Create a storage engine for BerkeleyDB.
- Add the ability to call Machine Learning algorithms from command line or Python:
    - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/javabridge
    - https://github.com/LeeKamentsky/python-javabridge/
    - https://github.com/fracpete/python-weka-wrapper


DOCUMENTATION
=============

- Improve the code documentation.
- Write How-to blog posts on building Text Classification models.


NEW ALGORITHMS
==============

- Speed up LDA: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~mingjia/cs240/doc/273811.pdf
- Factorization Machines: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf
- Develop the FunkSVD and PLSI as probabilistic version of SVD.
- Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets: http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf
- Write a Mixture of Gaussians clustering method.
- Include an anomaly detection algorithm.
- Provide a wrapper for DBSCANClusterer and NeuralNet implementations of Maths.
- Add the ability to search through the configuration space and find the best performing algorithmic configuration.
