CODE IMPROVEMENTS
=================

bbriniotis:
- Better memory configuration for MapDB.

lmpampaletakis:
- Can we avoid passing DatabaseConfiguration dbConf in constructors? Is it possible to inject automatically the object or store it and request it from within the algorithms?
- Review the codebase and make suggestions for code improvements and changes in the architecture.

other:
- Serialization improvements: set serialVersionUID?
- create the required exceptions
- CSV reader and converter to Dataset. Eliminate Dataset.value2ColumnType() to detect the types?


DOCUMENTATION
=============

- Documenting the code
- How-to blog post on building a Text Classification model


NEW ALGORITHMS
==============

- include an anomaly detection algorithm
- develop the FunkSVD: Also PLSI as probabilistic version of SVD
- ability to search through the configuration space and find the best performing algorithmic configuration
