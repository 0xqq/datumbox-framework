CODE IMPROVEMENTS
=================

- Improve Serialization by setting the serialVersionUID in every serializable class?
- Create better Exceptions and Exception messages.
- Add multithreading support.
- Check out the Sparse Matrices/Vectors in Apache Math3 library. Use them in GaussianDPMM, MultinomialDPMM and MatrixLinearRegression.
- Add the ability to call Machine Learning algorithms from command line like in Mahout.
- Support the remove operations on the Dataframe. Look for "CONTINUOUS_ID_ASSUMPTION" within the code for problematic areas.

- Update all maven plugins and dependencies to their latest versions.
	- Add support for MapDB 2.0 once a stable version is released.
	- Upgrade maven-surefire to 2.19.1 once it is released.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

- Improve the code documentation.
- Write How-to blog post on building a Text Classification model.


NEW ALGORITHMS
==============

- Rewrite PCA to avoid using RealMatrix.
- Add regularization in the currenlty supported algorithms.
- Write a Mixture of Gaussians clustering method.
- Develop the FunkSVD and PLSI as probabilistic version of SVD.
- Include an anomaly detection algorithm.
- Add the ability to search through the configuration space and find the best performing algorithmic configuration.
